## üìö `Modules`

1. [Server - Client Side](https://github.com/thepwnexperts/m1) ‚úÖ **Done**

   This module focuses on implementing secure coding practices for the server-client architecture. Learn how to handle data securely between the server and client sides, prevent common vulnerabilities, and ensure secure communication.

2. [Types of Authentication](https://github.com/thepwnexperts/m2)

   In this module, explore different types of authentication mechanisms and their secure implementation. Protect user identities and ensure secure access to the application.

3. [Password Hashes and Storage](https://github.com/thepwnexperts/m3)

   The module covers various methods for securely hashing and storing passwords. Protect user passwords from unauthorized access, implement password storage best practices, and ensure confidentiality.

4. [Input Sanitization (WAF)](https://github.com/thepwnexperts/m4) üìà **In Progress**

   This module focuses on input sanitization techniques, particularly implementing a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to prevent common vulnerabilities. Learn how to sanitize user inputs effectively and protect against malicious data.

5. [Impact Mitigation (Isolation)](https://github.com/thepwnexperts/m5)

   In this module, explore strategies for mitigating the impact of security breaches. Learn isolation techniques that help contain and minimize the consequences of security incidents.

6. [Rate Limiting (On Application)](https://github.com/thepwnexperts/m6)

   The module addresses the importance of rate limiting and implements techniques to prevent abuse and ensure application stability. Control the rate of incoming requests and protect against various types of attacks.

7. [Fail2Ban (On System - Blue Teaming)](https://github.com/thepwnexperts/m7)

   This module focuses on using Fail2Ban, a popular intrusion prevention tool, to enhance system security from a blue teaming perspective. Learn how to detect and respond to suspicious activities on the system.

8. [Authorization (Secure Permission Levels)](https://github.com/thepwnexperts/m8)

   In this module, implement secure authorization mechanisms and permission levels to ensure proper access control. Manage user roles, permissions, and secure sensitive operations.

9. [Secure Work Practices (e.g., .env on Server)](https://github.com/thepwnexperts/m9)

   The module covers secure work practices, such as properly handling sensitive information like environment variables (.env) on the server. Protect sensitive data and avoid common security pitfalls during development.

10. [Secure and Reliable Communication](https://github.com/thepwnexperts/m10)

    This module focuses on establishing secure and reliable communication channels. Implement encryption, secure protocols, and other relevant techniques to protect data during transmission.
