## üöÄ `Project Overview`

Welcome to the **Secure Coding Project**! Our mission is to enhance code security by identifying vulnerabilities and implementing secure coding practices. By contributing to this project, you will gain valuable experience in secure coding techniques and make a positive impact on the security of software applications.

## üìö `Modules`

1. [Server - Client Side](/m1/) ‚úÖ **Done**

   This module focuses on implementing secure coding practices for the server-client architecture. Learn how to handle data securely between the server and client sides, prevent common vulnerabilities, and ensure secure communication.

2. [Authentication](/m2/)

   In this module, explore different types of authentication mechanisms and their secure implementation. Protect user identities and ensure secure access to the application.

3. [Password Hashes and Storage](/m3/)

   The module covers various methods for securely hashing and storing passwords. Protect user passwords from unauthorized access, implement password storage best practices, and ensure confidentiality.

4. [input filtration and Input Sanitization (WAF)](/m4/) üìà **In Progress**

   This module focuses on input sanitization techniques, particularly implementing a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to prevent common vulnerabilities. Learn how to sanitize user inputs effectively and protect against malicious data.

5. [Impact Mitigation (Isolation)](/m5/)

   In this module, explore strategies for mitigating the impact of security breaches. Learn isolation techniques that help contain and minimize the consequences of security incidents.

6. [Rate Limiting (On Application)](/m6/)

   The module addresses the importance of rate limiting and implements techniques to prevent abuse and ensure application stability. Control the rate of incoming requests and protect against various types of attacks.

7. [Misconfiguration](/m7/)

   This module focuses specifically on misconfigurations related to web applications and their impact on security. Learn about common web application misconfigurations that can expose vulnerabilities and understand how to identify and remediate them effectively.

   The module covers a range of web application misconfigurations, including insecure server settings, weak access controls, improper handling of user input, and other important configurations like SPF (Sender Policy Framework) records. Although SPF records are typically associated with system misconfigurations, they are included in this module due to their importance in enhancing email security and preventing spoofing attacks.

   By studying practical examples and best practices, you will gain valuable insights into the consequences of these misconfigurations and how to prevent them. Understanding web application misconfigurations is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of your web applications.

   Note: For comprehensive coverage of network and system misconfigurations, separate modules will be provided. However, the inclusion of important configurations like SPF records in this web application misconfiguration module highlights their significance in overall system security.

8. [Authorization (Secure Permission Levels)](/m8/)

   In this module, implement secure authorization mechanisms and permission levels to ensure proper access control. Manage user roles, permissions, and secure sensitive operations.

9. [Secure Work Practices (e.g., .env on Server)(human errors)](/m9/)

   The module covers secure work practices, such as properly handling sensitive information like environment variables (.env) on the server. Protect sensitive data and avoid common security pitfalls during development.

10. [Secure and Reliable Communication](/m10/)

    This module focuses on establishing secure and reliable communication channels. Implement encryption, secure protocols, and other relevant techniques to protect data during transmission.

##  `extra`
1. advanced restrictions

  Delve into advanced restriction techniques for enhancing security beyond the basics. Explore techniques like time,location,ip,device based access and other preventive measures.

2. ids/ips

  Learn about IDS and IPS technologies that can actively monitor and respond to potential threats. Understand how to set up and configure these systems to enhance the security of your applications.

3. security headers

  security headers for bare minimum and standard security.
