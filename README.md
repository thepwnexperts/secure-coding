## üöÄ `Project Overview`

Welcome to the **Secure Coding Project**! Our mission is to enhance code security by identifying vulnerabilities and implementing secure coding practices. By contributing to this project, you will gain valuable experience in secure coding techniques and make a positive impact on the security of software applications.

---

## üìö `Modules`

1. [Server - Client Side](/m1/) ‚úÖ **Done**

   Focus on implementing secure coding practices for server-client architecture. Learn how to securely handle data between server and client, prevent common vulnerabilities, and ensure secure communication.

2. [Input Filtration and Input Sanitization (WAF)](/m4/) üìà **In Progress**

   Learn input sanitization techniques and Web Application Firewall (WAF) implementation to protect against common vulnerabilities by sanitizing user inputs effectively.

3. [Authentication & Authorization](/m2/)

   Explore and implement secure authentication mechanisms and authorization permission levels to manage user roles, access control, and protect sensitive operations.

4. [Limiting(req and size) (On Application)](/m6/)

   Implement rate limiting techniques to prevent abuse, ensure application stability, and control the rate of incoming requests.

5. [Misconfiguration](/m7/)

   Learn about common web misconfigurations that expose vulnerabilities, such as insecure server settings and improper handling of sensitive files (`.env`, `.htaccess.backup`). Avoid information disclosure by securing sensitive information properly.

6. [Secure Work Practices (e.g., .env on Server)(Human Errors)](/m9/)

   Implement secure work practices to protect sensitive data such as environment variables, avoid human errors, and mitigate common security pitfalls during development.

7. [others(remaining)]()

    remaining practice and vulnerabilities

##  `Extra`

-- [Secure and Reliable Communication](/m10/)

    Establish secure communication channels using encryption, secure protocols, and other relevant techniques to protect data during transmission.
